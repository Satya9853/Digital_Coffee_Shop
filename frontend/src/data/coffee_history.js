    about:
      "For the first iced coffee we have to go back to 1840, in Algeria. The first iced coffee was called mazagran (or masagran). It was a cold and sweet coffee drink invented by the French army during the Battle of Mazagran. At the time, the French army was engaged in fighting Arab and Berber forces as part of the 17-year conquest of Algeria.When the milk ran out, they added water to their coffee and decided to drink the coffee cold to combat the heat. Other soldiers near Mazagran were also served a similar type of coffee, made from coffee syrup mixed with water. Iced coffee was born.",

    about:
      "While the exact origin is often disputed, nitro coffee was reportedly first created by Portland-based food scientist Nate Armbrust.During his time working for Stumptown Coffee Roasters in 2013, Nate attempted to carbonate cold coffee. However, his initial attempts failed, as the introduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) substantially shifted the flavour profile and increased its acidity",

    about:
      "Espresso makes its debut at the 1906 World’s Fair in Milano. Luigi Bezzera and Desidero Pavoni have taken Moriondo’s idea and created a machine with a vertical boiler that brews a single cup of coffee in seconds. It is the first time people experience coffee made expressly for them: espresso.The espresso these early machines produce is very different from what we know today. The pressure in the portafilter is created by steam at 1.5 – 2 bars. The water is boiling when it comes in contact with the coffee bed. The shots are watery and bitter. Pavoni has some regional success with his Ideale machines, but they don’t gain wide acceptance.",

The first record of the cappuccino we have found was in the 1930s.'Cappuccini' (as they are known in Italy) gradually became popular in cafes and restaurants across the country. At this time, espresso machines were complicated and bulky, so they were limited to specialized cafes and were operated solely by baristi",

After they were harvested, the beans would be roasted and shipped to the port.    ",

The story goes, according to many sources including Lee Jollifee, PHD, that soldiers stationed in Italy during WWII were looking for a way to make the strong espresso they found there taste more like the coffee they were used to back in the States. When the soldiers returned home they brought the Americano back with them. Up to this point, black coffee was the norm, so how did we come to embrace the Americano as a daily coffee staple?",

It’s an extremely caffeinated drink, typically with 159 milligrams of caffeine in it, because of the strength from the drip coffee mixed in with the strength of the espresso shot. There’s not a definitive history of when the coffee came to be, but it seems to have originated in the United States, in the 90’s",

Head Chef Joe Sheridan, upon hearing of the planes imminent return, prepared coffees mixed with brown sugar, whiskey and cream to warm up the cold and tired passengers. After tasting the delightful mixture one of the passengers piped up and asked “Are these Brazilian coffees?” to which Joe replied “No, they’re Irish coffees!” and thus the legend was born.",
